## [0.3.023] - 2026-10-19
### Fixed

- **Update jobs no longer flashes an error while the update is still starting.** A slow launch used to
  turn the button into "Error" and show an error message, then the progress appeared seconds later as
  if nothing had gone wrong. The button now stays on the starting state until the run is confirmed or
  the start genuinely fails, and the launch no longer waits on background bookkeeping that can be held
  up while jobs data is being rewritten.
