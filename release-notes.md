## [0.3.017] - 2026-10-11
### Changed

- **Fetch runs cost substantially less time for the same jobs.** The app's most repeated
  text work — cleaning a title, folding a country name into its short form, keying a city —
  is now remembered instead of derived again for every occurrence, and two hot text steps use
  cheaper spellings that produce identical output. Measured by replaying the same recorded
  responses through one workload, across 12 paired runs: **median engine wall-clock time
  33.2% lower** (95% confidence interval 30.0% to 45.1% lower), with every pair keeping the
  same number of jobs, the same job identities and the same per-board outcomes.

- **A fetch run does far less repeated work, for the same jobs.** Building a job's public record was
  the single largest cost in a run: the app rebuilt that record in full — about 69 times per job —
  almost always just to read one or two fields out of it. Reading now happens without building the
  record, and a full record is built only for a step that actually needs one. Measured by replaying
  the same recorded responses through one workload, four paired runs: **median engine wall-clock
  time 22.8% lower** (95% confidence interval 18.9% to 25.3% lower), with every pair producing the
  same jobs, the same identities and the same per-board outcomes.

- **Job web addresses are no longer re-parsed every time they are mentioned.** Cleaning a job link,
  deriving its duplicate-detection identity and deciding whether the address is publicly reachable
  are each remembered per address, so the same parsing is not repeated for the same job across a
  run: **median engine time 15.1% lower** on the same workload (95% confidence interval 13.9% to
  15.2% lower), again with identical output.

- **The availability and lifecycle pass reads the same way.** Deciding a job's lifecycle state no
  longer builds a full record for every job before it knows whether it needs one, which removes
  about 91,000 record builds from a run and roughly half a second from that stage. It is the
  smallest of the steps above, and its effect on the run as a whole was too small for this method
  to resolve — so it is described as what it is: less wasted work, not a faster run.

### Fixed

- **A run's merged job list no longer depends on which board finished first.** Boards are
  fetched in parallel and now joined in the order they were selected; before, the order they
  happened to finish decided which copy of a duplicated posting survived. Two runs over the
  same responses disagreed by 508 rows (5,541 against 6,029 merges) and neither number was
  reproducible. The merged set is now a property of the run, so a count you read once still
  holds when you fetch the same boards again.

- **One broken link on one board no longer ends the whole run.** A board published a detail
  link that could never be a valid web address, which raised an address error the run did not
  expect and stopped a 2,046-board fetch at board 1,579 — the remaining 467 boards were never
  asked. An unusable address is now recorded as that board's own failure, with a message, and
  the run carries on.

### Added

- **A run report can now say why one board was slow.** With per-board request counters
  switched on (the optional `BALUFFO_FETCH_COUNTERS=1` setting), each board's row in the
  report carries how many requests reached the network, how many repeated an address already
  fetched, the response codes and error kinds it met, and how much text it received. They are
  counted per board and never per request, so a run pays nothing for them beyond the counting
  itself, and a report recorded without them keeps exactly the shape it has today.

### Notes

- **This release covers everything since 0.3.015.** The speed-ups and fixes prepared under the
  unreleased 0.3.016 ship here, under one version, so nobody has to install two of them.
- Nothing about a collected job changes. The same titles, locations, links, identities and counts
  come out of the same responses; what changed is how much work the app does to produce them.
- Every speed-up figure on this page is **engine time only** — each is its own paired experiment on
  one representative workload of replayed responses, so the numbers describe separate steps and do
  not add up. A live run also waits on the network, so the gain there will be smaller, and the
  smallest step's effect is below what that method can resolve.
- Distribution surfaces are unchanged. Each behaves as it did in 0.3.015:
  the same-origin Linux container,
  Umbrel raw-LAN installs,
  GHCR multi-arch image publishing,
  private community app-store metadata,
  wildcard browser CORS allow headers,
  desktop localhost bridge compatibility.
