# Changelog

> All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and Baluffo desktop releases use the project-specific release ordering documented in
[`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md).

Sections below are written for the people who use the app, not for its maintainers:
say what changed for them and what it means, in plain language. The repository
guardrail enforces a shape budget on the **top versioned section only** — at most
2,000 words and no single bullet over 1,200 characters — and prints an advisory,
non-blocking note when implementation detail (code filenames, repo paths, loader
ids, dunder attributes) leaks in.

### This file is a release log, not a history

It carries **the most recent 5 released versions plus `[Unreleased]`**, and nothing
older. `v0.3.002` was the last published release, so the sections below it are the
working record of what is queued for the next one.

Older history is **not lost — `git log` is the source of truth** for it. Clamping
this file exists because a 153-section changelog had become a version ledger nobody
read, and because keeping it current meant restating past entries every time the
version moved. A change is described once, in the release that actually shipped it.

Four rules the guardrail enforces so this cannot quietly regress:

- **At most 5 versioned sections**, plus `[Unreleased]`.
- **No bullet appears in two sections.** A change is claimed by exactly one release,
  so a release can never claim to have fixed something an earlier one already fixed.
- **A versioned section that never shipped may not queue below the last tagged release.**
  One or two versions are allowed to wait untagged above the newest tag -- the in-flight
  version between a bump and its release, and the release that just shipped, because
  Baluffo publishes by version string (the GHCR image tag comes from the app-version
  declaration, not from a git tag), so a real release can exist with no git tag at all. But an older
  section whose version was skipped and then superseded by a release that did get tagged
  describes a release nobody can install, and the notes generated for the next tag would
  leave its changes unread. Roll those changes into the section being released, or delete
  that section: `git log` keeps the history. The cross-channel checkpoint in
  [`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md) is the decision this rule refuses to let go unmade.
- **`[Unreleased]` sits above the versioned sections.** In-progress changes accumulate at
  the top of the file, directly above the section a release rolls up, so a reader meets
  them in the order they happened.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.021] - 2026-10-17
> **Desktop rollup.** This is the first desktop package since 0.3.017, so it also carries the
> user-facing work released on the container channel in 0.3.018 through 0.3.020.

### Changed

- **The private Umbrel app-store packaging is retired.** Baluffo still publishes the same-origin
  container image on GHCR, but the private store metadata, the Umbrel Compose deployment files, and
  the release steps that maintained them are gone. A version bump no longer looks for them, and the
  container workflow no longer treats them as a publish trigger.

### Notes

- **First desktop package since 0.3.017.** It also carries the user-facing work from 0.3.018 through
  0.3.020: provider boards are read directly instead of through a guessed careers page, saved-job
  state stays with the session that asked for it, Discovery stops re-asking boards it has already
  ruled out or that never answer, and the runtime database reclaims space instead of growing.
- Distribution surfaces are unchanged. Each behaves as it did in 0.3.020:
  the same-origin Linux container,
  GHCR multi-arch image publishing,
  wildcard browser CORS allow headers,
  desktop localhost bridge compatibility.

## [0.3.017] - 2026-10-11
### Changed

- **Fetch runs cost substantially less time for the same jobs.** The app's most repeated
  text work — cleaning a title, folding a country name into its short form, keying a city —
  is now remembered instead of derived again for every occurrence, and two hot text steps use
  cheaper spellings that produce identical output. Measured by replaying the same recorded
  responses through one workload, across 12 paired runs: **median engine wall-clock time
  33.2% lower** (95% confidence interval 30.0% to 45.1% lower), with every pair keeping the
  same number of jobs, the same job identities and the same per-board outcomes.

- **A fetch run does far less repeated work, for the same jobs.** Building a job's public record was
  the single largest cost in a run: the app rebuilt that record in full — about 69 times per job —
  almost always just to read one or two fields out of it. Reading now happens without building the
  record, and a full record is built only for a step that actually needs one. Measured by replaying
  the same recorded responses through one workload, four paired runs: **median engine wall-clock
  time 22.8% lower** (95% confidence interval 18.9% to 25.3% lower), with every pair producing the
  same jobs, the same identities and the same per-board outcomes.

- **Job web addresses are no longer re-parsed every time they are mentioned.** Cleaning a job link,
  deriving its duplicate-detection identity and deciding whether the address is publicly reachable
  are each remembered per address, so the same parsing is not repeated for the same job across a
  run: **median engine time 15.1% lower** on the same workload (95% confidence interval 13.9% to
  15.2% lower), again with identical output.

- **The availability and lifecycle pass reads the same way.** Deciding a job's lifecycle state no
  longer builds a full record for every job before it knows whether it needs one, which removes
  about 91,000 record builds from a run and roughly half a second from that stage. It is the
  smallest of the steps above, and its effect on the run as a whole was too small for this method
  to resolve — so it is described as what it is: less wasted work, not a faster run.

### Fixed

- **A run's merged job list no longer depends on which board finished first.** Boards are
  fetched in parallel and now joined in the order they were selected; before, the order they
  happened to finish decided which copy of a duplicated posting survived. Two runs over the
  same responses disagreed by 508 rows (5,541 against 6,029 merges) and neither number was
  reproducible. The merged set is now a property of the run, so a count you read once still
  holds when you fetch the same boards again.

- **One broken link on one board no longer ends the whole run.** A board published a detail
  link that could never be a valid web address, which raised an address error the run did not
  expect and stopped a 2,046-board fetch at board 1,579 — the remaining 467 boards were never
  asked. An unusable address is now recorded as that board's own failure, with a message, and
  the run carries on.

### Added

- **A run report can now say why one board was slow.** With per-board request counters
  switched on (the optional `BALUFFO_FETCH_COUNTERS=1` setting), each board's row in the
  report carries how many requests reached the network, how many repeated an address already
  fetched, the response codes and error kinds it met, and how much text it received. They are
  counted per board and never per request, so a run pays nothing for them beyond the counting
  itself, and a report recorded without them keeps exactly the shape it has today.

### Notes

- **This release covers everything since 0.3.015.** The speed-ups and fixes prepared under the
  unreleased 0.3.016 ship here, under one version, so nobody has to install two of them.
- Nothing about a collected job changes. The same titles, locations, links, identities and counts
  come out of the same responses; what changed is how much work the app does to produce them.
- Every speed-up figure on this page is **engine time only** — each is its own paired experiment on
  one representative workload of replayed responses, so the numbers describe separate steps and do
  not add up. A live run also waits on the network, so the gain there will be smaller, and the
  smallest step's effect is below what that method can resolve.
- Distribution surfaces are unchanged. Each behaves as it did in 0.3.015:
  the same-origin Linux container,
  Umbrel raw-LAN installs,
  GHCR multi-arch image publishing,
  private community app-store metadata,
  wildcard browser CORS allow headers,
  desktop localhost bridge compatibility.
